# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Project

This project explores Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a popular dimensionality reduction technique used in various fields such as machine learning, image processing, and finance. PCA aims to identify patterns and reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining the most important information.

## Objective
The primary goal of PCA is to transform a dataset with potentially correlated variables into a dataset with a smaller number of uncorrelated variables (principal components), thereby reducing the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variance.

## Methodology
- **Orthogonal Transformation**: PCA performs an orthogonal linear transformation of the data to create new uncorrelated variables called principal components.
- **Variance Maximization**: PCA aims to maximize the variance of the data along the principal components.
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: PCA identifies the principal components by computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the original data.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: After computing the principal components, PCA allows for the selection of a subset of these components that capture most of the variance in the data, achieving dimensionality reduction while preserving as much information as possible.

## Applications
PCA finds applications in various domains:
- Machine Learning: Dimensionality reduction before applying machine learning algorithms.
- Image Processing: Compression of images while retaining important features.
- Finance: Analyzing correlations among financial variables.

## Usage
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Build the PCA model and analyze the principal components.
- Visualize the results and interpret the findings.

## Conclusion
PCA is a powerful technique for dimensionality reduction and pattern recognition. By understanding the underlying concepts and applying PCA effectively, one can simplify complex datasets while retaining essential information.
